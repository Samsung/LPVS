#### Using docker-compose
 
Please fill all needed lines in file `application-properties` according to `README.md` instructions.

If you would like to use another than `root` user for DB that reflecting in fields in file `application.properties`:
```
 spring.datasource.username=user
 spring.datasource.password=password  
```
 needed to add two fields in `docker-compose.yml` file in section `environment` before or after `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` value:
```
  -MYSQL_USER: user
  -MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
```
Otherwise, if only `root` user is used
```
 spring.datasource.username=root
 spring.datasource.password=rootpassword  
```
than only need to fill one field
```
  -MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:rootpassword
```
 But in both cases `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` need to be filled.
 
 
Also directory of keeping MySQL data may be changed, line:
```
 - ./mysql-lpvs-data:/var/lib/mysql # db storage -by default it is directory in root of repository with name mysql-lpvs-data
```
