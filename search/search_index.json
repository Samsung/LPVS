Miscompliance may lead to legal disputes, fines, obligation to disclose intellectual property, as well as reputational damage. In projects with numerous external dependencies, it becomes challenging to track license obligations accurately. Also, when many collaborators are involved, the risk of unintentional license violations, such as through copy-pasting code snippets, increases. Furthermore, there are nuanced situations like dependencies with dual licensing or licenses that may change due to ownership, purpose, or legislative alterations. These factors can potentially turn previously safe dependencies into unsafe ones over time. To address these license-related risks for open-source code, we have developed the License Pre-Validation Service (LPVS) . This tool provides a solution to mitigate potential license issues. By analyzing the project, LPVS identifies its components and their respective licenses at every commit. Then it generates a list of potential issue cases, and communicates them to the developers as comments on GitHub. LPVS offers a comprehensive description of possible license violations, including the details on the location of risky code and an overview of the specific license-related issues. With LPVS , we aim at assisting developers and project teams with ensuring license compliance for their open-source code. By providing insights into the potential license violations and their implications, LPVS enables proactive management of license-related risks throughout the development process. We believe that LPVS will be an invaluable tool for maintaining the integrity of open-source projects and safeguarding against license infringements. Features License Scanners : LPVS integrates with the SCANOSS license scanner, allowing for comprehensive license analysis of the project's components. SCANOSS helps to identify the licenses associated with the codebase, ensuring the compliance with open-source license requirements. By leveraging SCANOSS, LPVS provides accurate and up-to-date information on the licenses used in the project. GitHub Review System Integration : LPVS seamlessly integrates with the GitHub review system, enhancing the collaboration and code review process. LPVS automatically generates comments on GitHub, highlighting potential license violations or issues within the codebase. This integration streamlines the review process, making it easier for the developers and collaborators to identify and address license-related concerns directly within the GitHub environment. Continuous Monitoring : LPVS facilitates continuous monitoring of license-related risks throughout the development process. By analyzing each commit, LPVS ensures that any changes or additions to the codebase are assessed for potential license violations. This ongoing monitoring allows developers to proactively manage license compliance and address any issues that arise in a timely manner. Risk Mitigation : LPVS aims at mitigating license-related risks by providing early detection and identification of potential violations. By alerting developers about potential issues and by providing the necessary information to understand and address them, LPVS empowers teams to take proactive steps to ensure compliance with open-source licenses. This helps mitigate the risk of legal disputes, financial liabilities, and reputational damage associated with license violations. With these features, LPVS assists developers to manage license compliance for their open-source projects effectively. By integration with license scanning tools, supporting the GitHub review system, and providing comprehensive issue descriptions, LPVS offers a robust solution for identifying and addressing license-related risks in the software development lifecycle.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#license-pre-validation-service-lpvs","text":"","title":"License Pre-Validation Service (LPVS)"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Open-source code (that is a software that is freely available for use, study, modification, and distribution) must meet conditions of the respective license(s) of all of its dependencies.

Introduction Code review is a process in which one or more developers are systematically tasked with reviewing the code written by another developer in order to find defects and improve it. Code review should be done by project maintainers considering code quality and safety, sharing best practices and this leads to better collaboration, creating a culture of review, building team confidence in the code. Code Review Process Initiating a Code Review All code changes must undergo a review before merging into the main branch. The developer initiates a code review by creating a pull request. Assigning Reviewers The pull request is automatically assigned to maintainers for review. Other team members should be added manually for review. Reviewing Code Reviewers are responsible for thoroughly examining the code changes. Check for adherence to coding standards, best practices, and project guidelines. Providing Constructive Feedback Reviewers must provide clear and constructive feedback on identified issues or improvements. Discussions within the pull request are encouraged to ensure a shared understanding. Requirements Review fewer than 400 lines of code at a time. Take your time. Inspection rates should under 500 LOC per hour. Do not review for more than 60 minutes at a time. Set goals and capture metrics. Authors should annotate source code before the review. Use checklists. Establish a process for fixing defects found. Foster a positive code review culture. Embrace the subconscious implications of peer review. Practice lightweight code reviews. Code changes must receive approval from at least two team members before merging. At least one maintainer's approval is required. Critical issues raised during the review must be addressed before approval. Non-blocking feedback should be addressed in subsequent iterations. Pull requests should be kept focused on specific features or fixes. Continuous improvement in code quality is encouraged. Self-verification Checklist Coding Standards : ensure the code follows the established coding standards. Functionality : verify that the code changes address the intended functionality or issue. Edge Cases : check for handling of edge cases and potential error scenarios. Testing : confirm that appropriate tests have been added or updated. Documentation : validate that code changes are well-documented, including inline comments and README updates. Security : assess the code for potential security vulnerabilities.","title":"Code review requirements"},{"location":"dev-guide/code-review-requirements/#code-review-requirements","text":"How to conduct code reviews in the LPVS project.","title":"Code review requirements"},{"location":"dev-guide/code-review-requirements/#introduction","text":"Code review is a process in which one or more developers are systematically tasked with reviewing the code written by another developer in order to find defects and improve it.

We welcome contributions! By contributing, you can help improve this project and make it better for everyone. Ways to Contribute Here are some ways you can contribute to this project: Report Bugs & Request Features \ud83d\udc1b\ud83d\udca1: Let us know if you find any bugs or have ideas for new features by creating an issue . Vulnerability Reporting \ud83d\udea8: If you discover a vulnerability in our project, please report it according to the Security guideline . Code Contributions \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f: Fix bugs, add new features, or improve the existing code. Documentation \ud83d\udcdd: Improve our documentation by correcting typos, clarifying instructions, or adding new content. Code Reviews \ud83d\udd0d: Review other contributors' pull requests to maintain code quality. Code Contribution If you want to contribute to the LPVS project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on GitHub, new technologies, and how to make constructive bug reports, feature requests, and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request. Note You can use templates to create a description of your pull request or issue, which will greatly simplify the LPVS team's work on reviewing and incorporating your code. However, using these templates is not mandatory, and we will always welcome any help. To make a clean pull request, follow the steps below: Fork the LPVS repository on GitHub and clone your fork to your development environment. git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/LPVS.git Warning If you have trouble setting up Git with GitHub in Linux or are getting errors like Permission Denied (publickey) , you must set up your Git installation to work with GitHub . Add the main LPVS repository as an additional Git remote called upstream . git remote add upstream https://github.com/samsung/lpvs Make sure there is an issue created for the task you are working on. All new features and bug fixes should have an associated issue to provide a single point of reference for discussion and documentation. If the issue already exists, leave a comment on that issue indicating that you intend to work on it. If it doesn't exist, open a new issue for your task. Note For small changes or documentation issues, creating an issue is not necessary, and a pull request is sufficient. Fetch the latest code from the main LPVS branch. git fetch upstream Warning You should start at this point for every new contribution to make sure you are working on the latest code. Create a new branch for your feature based on the current LPVS main branch. Each separate bug fix or feature addition should have its own branch. Branch names should be descriptive and start with the number of the corresponding issue, if applicable. If you're not fixing a specific issue, you can skip the number. git checkout upstream/<NAMED_RELEASE> git checkout -b 999 -name-of-your-branch-goes-here Info Above, can be '1.0.0', etc. - see the list of releases or main branch. Write your code and make the necessary changes. Follow the coding conventions and style guidelines used in the LPVS project. Write clear, concise, and well-documented code. Include unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code. If you're adding a new feature, consider updating the relevant documentation and examples. If you're fixing a bug, provide a clear explanation of the issue and how your code resolves it. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message. Make sure to mention the issue number with #XXX so that GitHub will automatically link your commit with the issue. Additionally, use appropriate commit message prefixes to categorize your changes. feat : Introduce a new feature or enhancement. fix : Address a bug or resolve an issue. chore : Perform routine tasks or maintenance. docs : Make changes to documentation. style : Implement code style changes (e.g., formatting). test : Modify or add tests. refactor : Implement code refactoring. perf : Performance Improvements. build : Any changes in build conditions. ci : Implement any continuous integration changes. revert : Revert to previous code state. For example: git add path/to/my/file git commit -m \"feat: A brief description of this new feature which resolves #42\" --signoff git commit -m \"fix: A brief description of this bug fix which fixes #42\" --signoff git commit -m \"chore: A brief description of routine tasks or maintenance\" --signoff git commit -m \"docs: A brief description of documentation changes\" --signoff git commit -m \"style: A brief description of code style changes (e.g., formatting)\" --signoff git commit -m \"test: A brief description of changes related to testing\" --signoff git commit -m \"refactor: A brief description of code refactoring\" --signoff git commit -m \"perf: A brief description of performance improvements\" --signoff git commit -m \"build: A brief description of build conditions\" --signoff git commit -m \"ci: A brief description of continuous integration changes\" --signoff git commit -m \"revert: A brief description of revert previous code state\" --signoff Pull the latest LPVS code from upstream into your branch. git rebase upstream/main Push your code to your forked repository. git push -u origin my-feature Note -u parameter ensures that your branch will now automatically push and pull from the GitHub branch. That means if you type git push next time, it will know where to push to. Open a pull request against the upstream repository. Go to your repository on GitHub and click Pull Request . Choose your branch on the right and enter some more details in the comment box. To link the pull request to the issue, include #999 in the pull request comment, where 999 is the issue number. Info Each pull-request should fix a single change. Someone from the LPVS team will review your code, and you might be asked to make some changes. If requested, make the necessary changes and push them to your branch. The pull request will be updated automatically. Once your code is accepted, it will be merged into the main branch and become part of the next LPVS release. If your code is not accepted, don't be discouraged. LPVS aims to meet specific requirements and priorities, and your contribution will still be available on GitHub as a reference for others. After your contribution is merged or declined, you can delete the branch you've worked on from your local repository and your forked repository: git checkout main git branch -D my-feature git push origin --delete my-feature Code of Conduct Everyone interacting in the LPVS project's codebases and issue trackers is expected to follow the Code of Conduct .","title":"Contributing guide"},{"location":"dev-guide/contributing/#contributing","text":"An introduction to contributing to the LPVS project.

Additionally, use appropriate commit message prefixes to categorize your changes. feat : Introduce a new feature or enhancement. fix : Address a bug or resolve an issue. chore : Perform routine tasks or maintenance. docs : Make changes to documentation. style : Implement code style changes (e.g., formatting). test : Modify or add tests. refactor : Implement code refactoring. perf : Performance Improvements. build : Any changes in build conditions. ci : Implement any continuous integration changes. revert : Revert to previous code state. For example: git add path/to/my/file git commit -m \"feat: A brief description of this new feature which resolves #42\" --signoff git commit -m \"fix: A brief description of this bug fix which fixes #42\" --signoff git commit -m \"chore: A brief description of routine tasks or maintenance\" --signoff git commit -m \"docs: A brief description of documentation changes\" --signoff git commit -m \"style: A brief description of code style changes (e.g., formatting)\" --signoff git commit -m \"test: A brief description of changes related to testing\" --signoff git commit -m \"refactor: A brief description of code refactoring\" --signoff git commit -m \"perf: A brief description of performance improvements\" --signoff git commit -m \"build: A brief description of build conditions\" --signoff git commit -m \"ci: A brief description of continuous integration changes\" --signoff git commit -m \"revert: A brief description of revert previous code state\" --signoff Pull the latest LPVS code from upstream into your branch. git rebase upstream/main Push your code to your forked repository. git push -u origin my-feature Note -u parameter ensures that your branch will now automatically push and pull from the GitHub branch. That means if you type git push next time, it will know where to push to. Open a pull request against the upstream repository. Go to your repository on GitHub and click Pull Request . Choose your branch on the right and enter some more details in the comment box. To link the pull request to the issue, include #999 in the pull request comment, where 999 is the issue number. Info Each pull-request should fix a single change. Someone from the LPVS team will review your code, and you might be asked to make some changes. If requested, make the necessary changes and push them to your branch. The pull request will be updated automatically. Once your code is accepted, it will be merged into the main branch and become part of the next LPVS release. If your code is not accepted, don't be discouraged. LPVS aims to meet specific requirements and priorities, and your contribution will still be available on GitHub as a reference for others. After your contribution is merged or declined, you can delete the branch you've worked on from your local repository and your forked repository: git checkout main git branch -D my-feature git push origin --delete my-feature","title":"Code Contribution"},{"location":"dev-guide/contributing/#code-of-conduct","text":"Everyone interacting in the LPVS project's codebases and issue trackers is expected to follow the Code of Conduct .","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"dev-guide/integration/","text":"Integration guide Use of LPVS JAR in your project Authenticating with a personal access token You can authenticate to GitHub Packages with Apache Maven by editing your ~/.m2/settings.xml file to include your personal access token.
