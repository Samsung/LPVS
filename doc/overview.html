<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Open-source code refers to software that is freely available for use, study, modification, and distribution, subject to meeting the conditions of the corresponding license. Failure to comply with the license conditions can lead to legal disputes, financial liabilities, the requirement to disclose intellectual property, and reputational damage.</p>

<p>In projects with numerous external dependencies, accurately tracking license obligations can be challenging. The risk of unintentional license violations, especially in collaborative projects, increases. The License Pre-Validation Service (LPVS) addresses these license-related risks by analyzing the project, identifying components and their licenses at every commit, and generating a list of potential issues communicated as comments on GitHub.</p>

<p>LPVS assists developers and project teams in ensuring license compliance for their open-source code by providing insights into potential license violations and their implications.</p>
