/**
 * This package contains configuration classes related to the security setup of the application.
 * It includes classes for configuring OAuth2 authentication, security filters, and Cross-Origin
 * Resource Sharing (CORS) settings. These configurations are crucial for defining the behavior
 * of the application with respect to user authentication, authorization, and access control.
 *
 * <p>
 * The central class in this package is {@link com.lpvs.config.SecurityConfig}, which orchestrates
 * security settings, OAuth2 integration, and CORS support. It utilizes Spring Security features
 * to establish a robust security architecture for the application.
 * </p><p>
 * Other classes in this package contribute to specific aspects of the security configuration,
 * such as defining custom success handlers, handling OAuth2 user details, and configuring CORS
 * policies for cross-origin requests.
